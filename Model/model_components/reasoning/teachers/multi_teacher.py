"""Agreement-based fusion of several teachers (issue #98/#103).

Fusing multiple annotators with per-label agreement substantially improves
multi-label pseudo-label quality over the best single VLM (+47-55% F1 in a
dashcam multi-label study, arXiv:2510.01126; the multi-teacher pattern is also
how Hydra-MDP won the NAVSIM challenge, arXiv:2406.06978).  The fused target
is the **fraction of teachers that agree** on each label — which doubles as
the soft confidence signal for the per-horizon confidence head (#103), instead
of trusting any single teacher's (systematically over-confident) self-report.
