"""Reasoning-band faithfulness check via intervention (#98/#103).

Recent VLA benchmarks show that a model's stated reasoning can be *decorative*
rather than causal — high observational alignment while interventions on the
reasoning leave the trajectory unchanged (VLADriveBench, arXiv:2606.12706).
This module measures the opposite, causal notion directly in our stack: run
the same batch **with and without the reasoning band's planner coupling** and
report how much the trajectory actually moves.

Because the band's gate is zero-initialised (no-op), the delta is exactly 0.0
at initialisation and only becomes positive once training pushes the gate away
from zero — so this doubles as a regression check that enabling the band does
not perturb the reactive baseline before training.
