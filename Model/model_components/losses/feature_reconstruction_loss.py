class FeatureReconstructionLoss(nn.Module):
    """JEPA-style feature reconstruction loss for the FutureState world model.

    Compares the future BEV feature maps predicted by ``FutureState`` (a
    tuple/list of ``num_future_steps`` tensors, each ``[B, C, H, W]``) against
    target feature maps of identical shapes. Following the JEPA recipe, the
    loss lives in *feature space* rather than pixel space: in production the
    targets are extracted by a frozen copy of the image backbone (no gradient)
    applied to the future frames at +1.6s, +3.2s, +4.8s and +6.4s, so the
    world model learns to predict abstract scene dynamics instead of
    reconstructing pixels.

    Supports mean reduction (optionally weighted per future timestep) and a
    ``"none"`` reduction that returns the per-timestep losses for logging.
